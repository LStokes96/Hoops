Fundamental Project
For this project we had been tasked with creating a CRUD application, using methodologies and supporting tools we have learned during our training. This app must contain a realational database, consiting of at least 2 tables. The app will be created in python,with a flask front-end, and deployed on GCP.  

# The App
The inital idea I had for this project was an app that could help with fantasy teams, or sport betting. which allowed the user to search a certain team or player, and the app would show some statistics, as well as having a comment section, where users could see up to date comments regarding ther given player/team. 

This would satisfy the CRUD functionality allowing, users to Create: profiles, and comments, Read: player statistics and comments, Update, and Delete: Comments. Throughout the project multiple elements were changed but the bar player statistics, the CRUD functions stayed the same.
